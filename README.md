# Banglore-house-price-prediction

This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction model. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.During model building all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc have been used. Technology and tools wise this project covers:

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
